          Hi, I'm Manmohan, an enthusiastic and self-driven undergraduate
          student at Ahmedabad Institute of Technology, passionate about
          software development and problem-solving. I specialize in C, Python,
          HTML, React.js, and MySQL, and I enjoy building efficient and
          user-friendly web applications.
          <br /> With a strong work ethic and a continuous desire to learn, I
          actively seek opportunities to grow both technically and
          professionally. I'm open to full-time or part-time roles, and Iâ€™m
          excited to contribute to a team where I can apply my skills and gain
          hands-on experience in real-world projects.
